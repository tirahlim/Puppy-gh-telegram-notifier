# telegram-notifier

## Goal

When someone commit a change in the repository, an action is triggered and send a notification to Telegram to notify members.


## Testing Process

In this example, I used two different Github accounts (tirahlim & nusfintech88).

When either one of them commit a change, a notification will be send to Group Telegram, with the id of the one who make the changes.
